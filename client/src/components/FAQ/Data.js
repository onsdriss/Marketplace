      question: 'How does a hydrogen fuel cell work?',
      answer: 'A fuel cell vehicle works a bit like an internal-combustion engine except that the system doesn’t burn the hydrogen that it draws from a pressurized tank but fuses it with oxygen to produce electricity to power an electric motor. The process takes place in a PEM (Polymer electrolyte membrane) fuel cell made up of sets of thin plates, separated by membranes.'

      question: 'How is being hydrogen used in trucks?',
      answer: 'Hydrogen can be used to fuel an internal combustion engine, which is similar to a Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) engine. Another solution is to use hydrogen in a fuel cell where it generates electricity to power the vehicle. Hydrogen can also be used as an auxiliary fuel cell to extend range on a battery-powered electric vehicle.'

      question: 'How environmentally friendly is hydrogen?',
      answer: 'When hydrogen reacts with oxygen in a fuel cell, the only output is water. So, when a truck is powered by a fuel cell there are no harmful tailpipe emissions. But any measure of climate impact  also has to take into account the production process for hydrogen which is very energy intensive. Most hydrogen today is produced using coal or natural gas. But if the electricity used for production comes from renewable energy sources, the hydrogen fuel can have a close to neutral carbon footprint (this is known as ‘green hyrogen’).'
